    You're given a positive integer n. Write an algorithm that does the following:
        - If n is even, the algorithm divides n by 2. This is the new value of n
        - If n is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by 3 and adds 1. This is the new value of n.
        - The algorithm repeats this until n == 1.

    Implement this algorithm in this function and return a list of all the intermediate values of n.
    For example, if n = 3, the sequence of values is: 3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
    So, your function would return: [3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
